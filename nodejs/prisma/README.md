# Connecting to PlanetScale from Prisma

This example demonstrates how to connect a Prisma + Node.js application to a PlanetScale database using two different methods:

Follow the instructions below to find and insert your PlanetScale credentials.

## Getting the credentials

1. In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com), select the database you want to connect to.
2. Click "**Branches**" and select the branch you want to connect to.
3. Click "**Connect**".
4. Select "**Prisma**" from the "**Connect from**" dropdown.
5. If the password is blurred, click "**New password**".
6. Copy the credentials. You won't be able to see the password again.

## Connecting your database

1. Open your `schema.prisma` file and replace `datasource db {}` with the code in our [`schema.prisma` example file](https://github.com/planetscale/connection-examples/blob/main/nodejs/prisma/schema.prisma).
2. Replace the placeholders for `HOSTNAME`, `DATABASE`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` with the copied values. We encourage you to move these placeholder values into your `.env` file.
